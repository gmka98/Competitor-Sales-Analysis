## 🧠 Context

Understanding not only how a company performs internally but also how it stacks up against competitors is critical for strategic decision-making. In this case study, the business aims to assess both **sales performance** and **market share** across various products, regions, and competitors. This enables more targeted decisions in pricing, promotion, and product development.

You will take on the role of a data analyst tasked with delivering a robust Power BI report that reflects both internal sales data and external competitor metrics.

## ✅ Solution

- **ETL Process** using Power Query to ingest and clean data from multiple sources
- **Data Modeling** to structure relationships between products, time, regions, and competitors
- **DAX Calculations** to derive performance indicators such as market share, sales growth, and category contribution
- **Interactive dashboards** to visualize:
  - Sales trends by product and region
  - Market comparison vs. competing manufacturers
  - Insights into areas of underperformance or opportunity

The report is designed to help business users make fast, informed, and data-driven decisions.
